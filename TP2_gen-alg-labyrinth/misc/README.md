They play no part in the current version of the GA.

## test_min

This is a test to try and discover the faster method to retrieve a minimal value among a list of individuals.\
So far the numpy one is always the faster - so numpy is privilieged for the AG methods.

## old_eval

The AG was based on CXonePoint and weighted manhattan evaluations before going to a growing one.\
This file contains the old fitness function for achive purpose.
